# Play-with-the-Game-Boy-Camera-Mitsubishi-M64282FP-sensor
A set of codes to address the Mitsubishi M64282FP artificial retina with Arduino.

Simply grab the eye ball of a GB camera, connect to the Arduino (harvest or buy a JST ZH1.5MM 9 Pin connector for cleaner job), upload the code to the board, run the Octave code and enjoy your images !

Images are crop in 112x128 pixels by default but the sensor outputs 128x128 pixels images. User may modify the code to save the whome image.
